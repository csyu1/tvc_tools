## Reports Automation TO-DO

Ideal workflow is running the file once a month, and it would create the Google Form, and the Spreadsheet.
Do FSGO's need to see previous months? Current month may be enough.
Allow search previous reports by name (up to 12 months?)
Group by service year? Service year starts in September and ends in August. e.g. 2023 Service year is Sept 2022-Aug 2023
Need to track no reports for previous up to 6 months
Keep up to 2 years of reports only
